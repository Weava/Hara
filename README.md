# GameEngine (I don't have a name yet)


## How to use

### Windows

1. Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)

2. If you don't have Visual Studio installed, you can install the [latest version](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). If you prefer to use a non Visual Studio IDE to build you can simply install the [Visual Studio build tools](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe)

3. From a command line run `scripts/windows/build.bat`

4. If everything is good, the program should build and start on its own. At this point you should have solution files to use for Visual Studio if you'd like to use it.
